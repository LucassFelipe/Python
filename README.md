# Youtuber War Simulator

###### The most recent version is youtubeWarSimulator3.py, but if you don't like, you can try the older versions.
##### Here I have the Youtuber War Simulator project, I couldn't find anything on the internet like my program, so I did this.
##### My inspiration is Pewdiepie vs T-series.
##### You need [Python3](https://python.org/) to run my project, works with Windows, MacOS, Linux and probably many other operating systems that have Python support.
