# Youtuber War Simulator

Here i have the Youtuber War Simulator project, i couldn't find anything on the internet like my program, so i did this.
My inspiration is Pewdiepie vs T-series.
You need [Python3](https://python.org/) to run my project, works with Windows, MacOS, Linux and probably many other operating systems that have Python support.
This program only works in terminal, i don't know how to make a graph with this project, if you know, please contact me.
