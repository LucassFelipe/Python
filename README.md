# Youtuber War Simulator

###### The most recent version is youtuberWarSimulator2.py, but if you don't like, you can try the older version.
##### Here i have the Youtuber War Simulator project, i couldn't find anything on the internet like my program, so i did this.
##### My inspiration is Pewdiepie vs T-series.
##### You need [Python3](https://python.org/) to run my project, works with Windows, MacOS, Linux and probably many other operating systems that have Python support.
##### This program only works in terminal, i don't know how to make a graph with this project, if you do, please contact me. (lucasfelipe.oliveira.souza7@gmail.com)
